TokenStocks Regenerative Architecture (Recommended Model)
1. Liquidity Pool (LP) = Regenerative Capital Base

Funded by grants, CSR, patient capital.

Non-return-seeking (or low-return, e.g. 3–5% per annum).

Role: Seed new projects + provide emergency liquidity.

When used, it must be replenished from project cashflows and token buybacks.

2. Project Wallet = Operating Entity

Receives NGNTS investments.

Uses funds for production (e.g. farm inputs, operations).

Generates cashflow from product sales.

Periodically sends a portion of profit → Treasury Pool.

This is your Reflow Mechanism — where on-chain value comes back into the ecosystem.

3. Treasury Pool (New Wallet Type) 🏦

Receives:

Project cashflow allocations (profit shares)

LP repayments

Platform fees

Uses:

To top up LP wallet (recycle capital)

To fund new projects

To pay out performance bonuses (optional in TKX later)

This treasury acts as the bridge between real-world revenue and token liquidity.

4. Investor Exit Path

Let’s look at your earlier concern:

“Investors want to redeem or sell, but project can’t yet buy back, and LP shouldn’t cover all of it.”

✅ Solution: Hybrid buyback model with phased funding sources

Step 1: Investor initiates “Sell” (Secondary Market)

LP evaluates the request (e.g. 100 tokens @ 10 NGNTS each = 1,000 NGNTS).

System checks liquidity sources in this priority order:

Priority	Source	Description	Example
1	Project Cashflow Wallet	If project has partial liquidity	Use recent sales proceeds (e.g. 400 NGNTS)
2	Treasury Pool	Use ecosystem revenue (reflows)	Add 400 NGNTS
3	LP Wallet	Use patient capital if shortfall remains	Cover last 200 NGNTS
Total Paid Out:			1,000 NGNTS

After the buyback:

Tokens are burned or returned to Project Wallet.

The same 1,000 NGNTS can later flow back to Treasury → LP → new projects.

Thus, your capital never truly “leaves” — it just rotates.

🔁 The Regenerative Loop (Lifecycle Summary)

LP Wallet funds Project A (10M NGNTS).

Project A produces crops, sells goods → generates 12M NGN cash.

5M NGN used for operations; 7M NGN sent back to Treasury Pool (on-chain NGNTS).

Treasury Pool:

2M NGNTS → LP replenishment

3M NGNTS → New Project B funding

2M NGNTS → Token buybacks for AGRO2025 investors

Each round regenerates the same pool of capital, compounding social impact.

🪙 Accounting for Appreciation

In your model:

Token value grows based on project NAV, not speculative market movement.

Appreciation is realized when:

The project pays out cashflow (dividends), or

Tokens are redeemed/bought back at higher rates.

Therefore:

On-chain price (NGNTS/token) remains dynamic via Treasury & LP valuations.

ROI is recorded when redemption occurs, not continuously marked-to-market.

This is standard for impact investment tokens and private RWA markets.
