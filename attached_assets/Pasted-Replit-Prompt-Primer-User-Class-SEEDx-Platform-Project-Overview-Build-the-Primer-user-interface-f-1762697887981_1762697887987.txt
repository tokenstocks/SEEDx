Replit Prompt: Primer User Class - SEEDx Platform
Project Overview
Build the Primer user interface for SEEDx, a regenerative capital exchange platform. Primers are institutional partners (foundations, CSR programs, impact funds) who provide grant/CSR capital to seed agricultural projects. They receive permanently locked tokens as proof of contribution (non-tradeable, non-redeemable).

Impact dashboard (jobs created, yield data)
Visual Design:

Permanently locked tokens: Red badge with lock icon
Clear messaging: "These tokens represent your impact contribution and cannot be traded or redeemed"
6. Impact Reporting
Impact Dashboard:

Aggregate metrics across all funded projects:
Total cashflows generated from your contributions
Growers enabled (secondary investors who bought tokens)
Regeneration multiplier (how many times capital has cycled)
Environmental impact (hectares cultivated, CO2 offset)
Downloadable Impact Report (PDF):
Quarterly/annual summary
Project-by-project breakdown
Photos/stories from the field
Suitable for CSR reporting
7. Notifications & Updates
Email + in-app notifications for:
Contribution confirmed
Project milestone reached
Cashflow regeneration completed
Impact report available
New project opportunities matching interests
