You are the lead developer of the TokenStocks platform.  
Provide a **complete, structured, and human-readable technical overview** of the current codebase and all implemented workflows.

Your output must be organized as follows:

## 1. Project Overview
Summarize in 5–10 lines what TokenStocks currently does, which tech stack it uses, and what the high-level user journey is (user registration → wallet activation → deposit → invest → withdraw).

## 2. Backend Architecture
- Describe the backend framework (Node.js/Express + TypeScript + Drizzle ORM or others).  
- List all API modules and what they handle (auth, wallets, deposits, withdrawals, projects, investments, setup, blockchain).  
- Explain how JWT auth, admin roles, and encryption work.  
- Mention any middlewares and utilities (stellarConfig, encryption helpers, verification endpoints).

## 3. Database Schema
List all current database tables and their purposes.  
For each table, list the key columns, relationships, and any constraints.  
Highlight where wallet balances, transactions, projects, and users intersect.  
If any tables are still placeholders or incomplete, indicate that.

## 4. Frontend Architecture
Describe the structure of the React/Vite/TypeScript frontend.  
Include:  
- How routing is handled (Wouter or similar)  
- Which pages and components currently exist  
- How state is managed (TanStack Query or context)  
- Which UI flows are implemented (registration, KYC, dashboard, admin panel, etc.)  
- Any missing UI features related to blockchain transparency or NGNTS conversion.

## 5. Blockchain Integration (Current State)
Explain exactly what blockchain functionality is live right now:  
- Which Stellar network is connected (testnet or mainnet)  
- What happens on project creation  
- How user wallets are created and funded  
- Whether token minting, transfers, and trustlines are active  
- How transaction hashes are stored and verified

## 6. Platform Wallets
List all existing platform wallets (Operations, Treasury, Distribution, Liquidity Pool, Admin if still present).  
For each, include:  
- Public key  
- Function/purpose in the system  
- Whether funded/active on Stellar testnet  
- Which modules reference it in the code.

## 7. Active Workflows
Document all implemented end-to-end workflows, step by step:
1. User registration & wallet activation  
2. Deposit request and admin approval  
3. Project creation & token minting  
4. User investment flow  
5. Withdrawal flow (if implemented)  
6. Any admin verification or setup checks  

Include: where database and blockchain intersect in each flow.

## 8. Pending or Placeholder Features
List any features mentioned in code comments or TODOs that are not yet complete (e.g., NGNTS issuance, secondary market, liquidity management, NAV calculation, cashflow tracking).

## 9. Security & Configuration
Summarize how secrets (Stellar keys, JWT secrets) are handled.  
Mention any environment variables, encryption standards (AES-256-CBC, bcrypt), and whether sensitive keys are excluded from responses.

## 10. Known Limitations
List all limitations you are aware of (from comments or architecture notes).  
Examples: missing rate limiting, async operations without retries, testnet-only, lack of job queues, etc.

## 11. System Health Summary
Provide a concise checklist of what’s verified working (✅) vs pending (⚠️).

## 12. Context for Architect (GPT-5 Strategist)
End by summarizing your *own understanding* of what the TokenStocks platform is ultimately building toward — the **fully on-chain NGNTS-based regenerative capital model** — and how far the current codebase is from that goal.

Use clear markdown headings, lists, and indentation.
Be exhaustive but readable — this is a systems audit, not a marketing brief.
