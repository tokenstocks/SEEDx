Re: RCX MVP - Gap Analysis & Implementation Roadmap
Date: November 13, 2025

Context
First, excellent work on the foundation. You've built a solid 60% of the RCX MVP:

✅ Clean user management with role-based access
✅ Complete KYC workflow with audit trails
✅ Four-wallet Stellar architecture
✅ Deposit/withdrawal systems
✅ Investment flow with on-chain settlement
✅ Admin dashboards
The platform is functional and well-architected. This gap analysis is about alignment, not criticism.

Purpose of This Document
We've compared your current implementation against the engineer's RCX workflow specification and identified:

What matches (already built correctly)
What's missing (needs building for MVP)
What's different (needs adjusting)
This document provides a clear roadmap to close the gaps and reach MVP launch.

Key Findings
✅ Strong Foundations (Keep as-is)
User roles, KYC, deposits, wallets, investments, portfolio, marketplace, admin tools
❌ Critical Missing Features (11-15 days)
Project Wallets - Each project needs its own Stellar wallet to hold allocated capital
Milestone System - Admin creates milestones → Approves → Burns NGNTS → Pays project
Revenue Distribution - Auto-distribute cashflows: 40% Regenerators / 30% LP Pool / 20% Treasury / 10% Project
NAV Formula - Auto-calculate: (Unspent + Deployed + Expected) / Tokens
Tokenization Sequence - Allocate capital first, then tokenize (not during creation)
🔄 Quick Adjustments (2-3 hours)
Investment payments should go to LP Pool (not Distribution wallet)
Revenue split should be 40/30/20/10 (not 20/80)
LP Pool display should exclude XLM gas reserves
Recommended Approach
Phase 1: Quick Wins (Day 1)
Fix the 3 quick adjustments first - these are single-line changes that improve regenerative capital flow immediately.

Phase 2: Project Wallets (Days 2-3)
Add Stellar wallet creation per project. This unblocks everything else.

Phase 3: Milestones (Days 4-7)
Build the milestone creation → approval → disbursement → NAV recalculation flow. This is the heart of RCX.

Phase 4: Revenue Distribution (Days 8-11)
Implement automated 40/30/20/10 split with proportional distribution to all token holders.

Phase 5: NAV Formula (Days 12-13)
Add formula-based NAV calculation with admin override capability.

Phase 6: Tokenization Sequence (Days 14-15)
Adjust project creation flow to separate allocation from tokenization.

Questions for You
Before starting, please clarify:

Milestone Bank Payouts - Should we manually record bank transfers to projects, or integrate with a banking API?
Expected Revenue - Should admins manually input forecasts, or do you have a forecasting tool?
Distribution Trigger - Should revenue distribution happen automatically when cashflow is recorded, or require admin approval?
Multisig Timeline - When should we implement multisig for the Treasury wallet? (Post-MVP or now?)
NAV Override - Should admins be able to override formula-calculated NAV values?
What We Need From You
Review the Gap Analysis (attached below)
Confirm the roadmap makes sense
Answer the 5 questions above
Provide effort estimates for each phase (validate our 11-15 day estimate)
Flag any blockers or dependencies we haven't considered
Success Criteria
When these gaps are closed, the platform will:

✅ Have true regenerative capital flow (LP Pool regenerates from project revenues)
✅ Support milestone-based project funding (real-world capital deployment)
✅ Auto-distribute cashflows to all stakeholders (40/30/20/10)
✅ Calculate NAV dynamically (reflects project health)
✅ Follow proper tokenization sequence (capital first, tokens second)
