RCX System Specification: Regenerative Capital Exchange
Core Concept
A regenerative capital system where grant/CSR funds are deployed, replenished, and redeployed continuously through tokenized projects.

1. ACTORS & ROLES
1.1 Primer (Catalyst)
Function: Contributes initial capital (grants, CSR funds, donations)
Contribution Target: Liquidity Pool (LP)
Does NOT receive: Tokens
Dashboard Access: View-only monitoring of:
Fund deployment to projects
LP replenishment cycles
Regenerator token purchases
Project performance metrics
Percentage of contribution to LP
etc.
1.2 Regenerator (Investor)
Function: Purchases project tokens from Project Market
Payment Flow: Funds go directly to LP (LP Replenishment Method #1)
Receives: Project tokens (ownership stake)
Rights: Token holder benefits per project parameters
1.3 Admin
Functions:
Disburse LP funds to approved projects
Record project revenue (bank deposit receipts)
Trigger token minting based on revenue
Manage project tokenization and market listing
etc.
1.4 Project
Receives: Initial funding from LP (disbursed by Admin)
Generates: Revenue from operations
Holds: Project wallet (funded via mirrored bank deposits)
Distributes: Profits per predefined parameters
2. LIQUIDITY POOL (LP) MECHANICS
2.1 LP Inflows (Replenishment Sources)
Method #1: Regenerator token purchases (100% to LP)
Method #2: Project revenue profit-sharing (% to LP per project parameters)
2.2 LP Outflows
Admin-approved disbursements to projects
3. PROJECT LIFECYCLE
Phase 1: Funding
Primer contributes → LP
Admin disburses → Project receives initial capital
Phase 2: Tokenization
Admin tokenizes project → Project Market listing
Status: "Tokenized & Active"
Tokens available for purchase by Regenerators
Phase 3: Token Sale
Regenerator purchases tokens → Funds flow to LP
Regenerator receives project tokens
Primer dashboard updates (shows token sale activity)
Phase 4: Revenue Generation
Project generates revenue → Bank account receives deposits
Admin uploads bank deposit receipt → System records inflow
System mints equivalent tokens → Project wallet funded (mirrors bank balance)
Post-MVP: Webhook automation replaces manual receipt upload

Phase 5: Profit Distribution
Project wallet distributes profits per parameters:
- X% to LP (Replenishment Method #2)
- Y% to token holders (Regenerators)
- Z% retained for operations
Post-MVP: Governance votes trigger distributions

  ↓ (contributes grants/CSR)
LIQUIDITY POOL (LP)
  ↓ (admin disburses)
PROJECT (receives initial funding)
  ↓ (gets tokenized)
PROJECT MARKET (tokens listed)
  ↓ (regenerator buys tokens)
LIQUIDITY POOL ← (funds return) [REPLENISHMENT #1]
  
PROJECT (generates revenue)
  ↓ (bank receives money)
ADMIN (uploads receipt)
  ↓ (system mints tokens)
PROJECT WALLET (funded to match bank)
  ↓ (distributes profits)
LIQUIDITY POOL ← (profit share) [REPLENISHMENT #2]
5. KEY DISTINCTIONS
Aspect	Specification
Primer gets tokens?	NO - View-only dashboard access
Token purchase destination?	100% to LP (not to project directly)
Project wallet funding?	Mirrored from bank deposits (admin-recorded)
LP replenishment sources?	(1) Token sales + (2) Project profit-sharing
Profit distribution trigger?	MVP: Predefined parametersPost-MVP: Governance votes
Revenue recording?	MVP: Manual receipt uploadPost-MVP: Webhook automation

7. CRITICAL CLARIFICATIONS
What this is NOT:
❌ Primer does not invest for returns
❌ Token purchases do not fund projects directly
❌ Projects cannot mint tokens arbitrarily
What this IS:
✅ Grant/CSR capital recycling system
✅ Token sales replenish the LP for redeployment
✅ Project revenue creates second replenishment stream
✅ Transparent tracking for all stakeholders
