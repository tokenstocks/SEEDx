# SEEDx MVP - Sustainable Ecosystem for Economic Development exchange

**Tagline**: Plant capital. Grow impact. A regenerative capital exchange.

## Overview
SEEDx is a blockchain-based regenerative capital platform on the Stellar network for tokenized agricultural participation. It connects Primers (liquidity providers) with Regenerators (token traders) to fund agricultural projects, facilitating automated cashflow distribution and capital regeneration. The platform uses SEC-compliant language, emphasizing utility tokens and participation to mitigate securities classification risk. It features secure authentication, KYC, multi-currency wallet management, and a premium mobile-first interface.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Design
The platform uses a React and TypeScript frontend with Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query, styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI for a mobile-first, fintech-inspired design. The backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, utilizing Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Authentication is JWT-based with bcrypt for password hashing and AES-256-CBC for encryption. Stellar SDK is integrated for blockchain operations, supporting a hybrid wallet model with encrypted Stellar secret keys.

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features an investor-grade presentation with Framer Motion animations, dynamic typewriter headlines, premium CTA buttons, interactive trust badges, and comprehensive mobile responsiveness. SEC-compliant language is used throughout the platform to mitigate securities classification risk. The landing page follows a strategic flow with dual audience toggles, how-it-works sections, featured farms, benefits showcase, comprehensive FAQ, and conversion-focused CTAs. The "About" page includes animated stats, feature highlights, a company timeline, and calls to action.

**Navigation System (Nov 2025):** Implemented UnifiedHeader component for consistent navigation across all authenticated pages. Features horizontal menu bar (no dropdowns), role-based navigation links (Admin: Dashboard + Browse Projects; Primer: Settings + Browse Projects; Regenerator: Settings + Browse Projects + Marketplace), wallet indicators for all roles (XLM, USDC, NGNTS balances with graceful fallbacks), and consistent logout placement. Layout: Logo (left) → Nav Links (centered) → Wallet Badges → Logout (far right). **Role detection uses boolean flags:** `isPrimer` and `isLpInvestor` flags determine role (not `role` string); regenerators are users without these flags. Settings link routes to role-specific profile pages (`/primer-profile`, `/regenerator-profile`).

**Regenerator Onboarding (Nov 2025):** Implemented hybrid onboarding flow: (1) Modal shows 2s after first visit to `/regenerator-dashboard` (tracked via sessionStorage), (2) Dismissible banner persists on subsequent visits until both KYC approval and wallet activation complete. KYC submission redirects to `/regenerator-profile` with improved toast messaging. Profile pages refetch KYC/wallet status on every mount to show current approval state.

### Technical Implementations
- **Authentication & KYC:** JWT-based authentication with automatic session expiry handling. User registration (Primer/Regenerator), and an admin-reviewed KYC system. **Security Fix (Nov 2025):** Global 401 response handler in `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts` automatically clears localStorage (token + user data) and redirects to `/login` when JWT token expires, preventing session mix-ups and confusing error states.
- **Stellar Integration:** Manages on-chain operations (testnet/mainnet), wallet activation, NGNTS token issuance, and a 4-wallet architecture (Operations, Treasury, Distribution, Liquidity Pool). Includes friendbot auto-activation for testnet operations and a robust wallet activation workflow with admin approval requiring both NGNTS and USDC trustlines.
- **Primer User Class & LP Pool:** Primers contribute capital to the Liquidity Pool via an admin-approved workflow, with their contributions and project allocations tracked on a dedicated dashboard and activity timeline.
- **Regenerator User Class:** Regenerators purchase farm project tokens, with a dashboard displaying portfolio holdings, metrics, and a comprehensive activity timeline.
- **Investment & Portfolio Management:** Full on-chain settlement for multi-currency investments (NGN/NGNTS, USDC, XLM). Investment flow: (1) Establish project token trustline, (2) Transfer payment from user to project on-chain, (3) Transfer project tokens from project to user, (4) Update database atomically. Includes best-effort automatic refund if token delivery fails after payment succeeds.
- **Regenerative Capital Architecture:** A multi-pool system with NAV-based token pricing and automated cashflow distribution.
- **Token Marketplace:** Internal peer-to-peer marketplace with order book, NAV-based price discovery, and atomic balance transfers.
- **LP Lock Policy Controls:** Flexible token lock mechanisms and an auto-unlock job.
- **NGNTS Burning:** NGNTS tokens are burned upon NGN withdrawal to maintain a 1:1 peg.
- **Admin Dashboards:** APIs and UI for managing key platform operations, users, and transactions.
- **Redemption System:** Allows users to sell project tokens for NGNTS, prioritizing funding from project cashflow, treasury, then liquidity pool.
- **Bank Deposit System (Nov 2025):** Two-phase NGN bank transfer deposit flow for NGNTS minting, matching TheFarmhouseClub UX pattern. **Flow:** (1) User enters amount and gets reference code upfront via POST /api/regenerator/bank-deposits/initiate, (2) User makes bank transfer with reference code, (3) User uploads proof via PATCH /api/regenerator/bank-deposits/:id/proof, (4) Admin reviews and approves/rejects. **Schema:** `regeneratorBankDeposits` table tracks deposits with unique reference codes (format: SD-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX), nullable proofUrl for two-phase flow, status tracking (pending/approved/rejected/completed), and fee calculations. **Fees:** 2% platform fee + Stellar gas fee (0.001 XLM converted to NGN via CoinGecko API). Fee calculation utility (`server/lib/depositFees.ts`) integrates with exchange rate service to provide real-time NGN totals. NGNTS credited = deposit amount minus all fees. **Multi-Step Wizard UI:** 4-step deposit interface (Enter Amount → Get Reference Code → Upload Proof → Success Modal) with copy-to-clipboard functionality, bank account details display, drag-and-drop file upload, and clear next steps. **Security:** User-scoped authorization enforced at both application and database levels; proof upload is immutable once set (enforced via status checks and SQL-level null constraints); concurrent modification returns 409 Conflict. **Admin Management:** Three endpoints (`GET /api/admin/bank-deposits`, `POST /api/admin/bank-deposits/:id/approve`, `POST /api/admin/bank-deposits/:id/reject`) enable admins to view pending deposits, approve transfers from Distribution wallet to user, or reject with reason. **Deposit History:** Regenerators view complete deposit history on profile page showing reference codes, amounts, fee breakdowns, status badges, rejection reasons (if rejected), Stellar transaction links (if approved), and timestamps. **Treasury Minting Architecture (Nov 2025):** Implemented on-demand NGNTS minting from Treasury wallet (unlimited supply). **Integrated Wallet Activation:** Bank deposit approval automatically activates user wallet if not already active (creates account + NGNTS/USDC trustlines), then mints NGNTS directly from Treasury to user wallet. **Cost per activation:** 3.0 XLM (2.0 XLM minimum reserves + 1.0 XLM buffer for account creation + 2 trustlines). Stellar reserve math: Base reserve 0.5 XLM, new account requires (2 + 0 subentries) × 0.5 = 1 XLM, each trustline adds 0.5 XLM (2 trustlines = +1 XLM), total minimum 2 XLM, buffer 1.0 XLM for fees. **Minting Service:** `mintNGNTS()` function in `server/lib/stellarOps.ts` creates new NGNTS supply by payment from Treasury issuer wallet. **Activation Service:** `activateRegeneratorWallet()` function in `server/lib/walletActivation.ts` bundles account creation and trustline establishment into minimal transactions. **Concurrency Protection:** Deposit approval uses database transaction with row-level locking (`FOR UPDATE`) and status check (`WHERE status='pending'`) to prevent double-minting when multiple admins approve same deposit concurrently.
- **Wallet Activation Admin Interface (Nov 2025):** Simplified admin approval system for activating regenerator wallets on Stellar network. **Auto-managed XLM approach**: XLM is treated as operational gas and managed automatically by the backend (fixed 3.0 XLM per activation for Stellar reserves + transaction fees). Users do not manually request XLM top-ups. **Admin Endpoints:** Three REST endpoints (`GET /api/admin/wallet-funding-requests?status={pending|approved|rejected}`, `POST /api/admin/wallet-funding-requests/:id/approve`, `POST /api/admin/wallet-funding-requests/:id/reject`) enable admins to review activation requests, approve first-time wallet activations (triggering automatic account creation, NGNTS/USDC trustline setup, and 3.0 XLM funding from Operations wallet), or reject with required reason. **Admin UI:** `AdminWalletFunding.tsx` component integrated into Admin.tsx via "Wallet Activation" tab. Features stats cards (pending, approved, rejected counts), pending/processed tabs, approve/reject dialogs with user details, wallet public key display with clipboard copy, and transaction hash tracking. **Database:** `regeneratorWalletFundingRequests` schema tracks activation requests with status, timestamps, transaction hashes array, rejection reasons, and audit trail (requestedBy, approvedBy, approvedAt). **Note:** Manual wallet funding is deprecated; wallets now auto-activate on first bank deposit.

### Known Limitations (MVP)
- **Investment Settlement Edge Cases:** The investment flow executes on-chain payment followed by token delivery. If token delivery fails, the system attempts an automatic refund. In rare cases where the refund also fails, funds remain with the project and require manual admin intervention. Full durable settlement system with retry queue deferred to post-MVP. All failure scenarios are logged with transaction hashes for reconciliation.
