1. Wallet Usage Confirmation
"You mentioned two wallets per project:
- operationsWalletPublicKey (for LP disbursements)
- revenueWalletPublicKey (for bank deposits)

Can you confirm:
1. When LP disburses funds to a project, which wallet receives it?
2. When admin records revenue (bank deposit), which wallet gets the mirrored tokens?
3. When profit distribution happens, which wallet sends the funds out?
4. Are these wallets used as INFLOW vs OUTFLOW, or both for different purposes?"
2. Fund Flow Verification
"Walk me through the complete transaction flow:

Scenario A: LP allocates 50,000 NGNTS to Project X
→ Which wallet receives this?
→ What database records are created?

Scenario B: Project X generates 100,000 NGN revenue (bank deposit)
→ Admin uploads receipt
→ Which wallet gets minted tokens?
→ What happens next?

Scenario C: Distribution execution (40% LP, 30% Regenerators, 20% Treasury, 10% Project)
→ Which wallet holds the funds to distribute?
→ Where does each allocation go?"
3. RCX Compliance Check
"Based on the RCX specification:
- Token purchases by Regenerators should go 100% to LP Pool ✅ (you confirmed this)
- Project revenue should flow back to LP as replenishment

Question: When distribution happens and LP gets its 40% share, 
does this go back to the LP Pool wallet to complete the regeneration cycle?"
4. Critical Gap - Regenerator View
"You mentioned:
❌ No page where individual Regenerators can see 'Your Distributions Received'

This is critical for RCX. Can you:
1. Estimate effort to build this (hours/days)?
2. Confirm the data already exists in regeneratorCashflowDistributions table?
3. Propose a simple implementation approach?"
5. Schema Cleanup Priority
"You flagged legacy fields as RCX violations:
- sharePercent in Primer flows
- sharePercentage in regeneratorCashflowDistributions
- lpPoolShareSnapshot in distributions

Question: Are these fields actively used in any calculations, 
or are they just displayed/stored but not affecting the actual RCX flow?"
