We’ve completed Phase 4-B backend implementation for the regenerative capital system. 
Now build the Phase 4-C frontend layer to match all new backend features and APIs.

Goal:
Add investor and admin GUIs for redemption management, treasury tracking, NAV updates, and audit visibility — fully wired to existing REST endpoints.

Stack:
Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Recharts
API endpoints already exist under /api/admin/* and /api/investments/*

Scope of Work:

1️⃣ Investor Redemption Interface
- Location: /portfolio
- Show all project tokens held, current NAV, and NGNTS equivalent value.
- “Redeem” button → opens modal to enter quantity and confirm sale.
- Call POST /api/investments/redemptions/create
- Show status list of redemption requests (pending, processing, completed, rejected) from GET /api/investments/redemptions/list

2️⃣ Admin Redemption Management
- New route: /admin/redemptions
- Table of pending redemptions with:
  • investor name
  • project token
  • amount
  • NAV at request
  • estimated payout (tokens × navAtRequest)
  • funding source used (project / treasury / LP)
  • status
- Approve/Reject buttons → call PUT /api/admin/redemptions/:id/process
- Include toast notifications and state refresh on action.

3️⃣ Treasury Dashboard
- New route: /admin/treasury
- Fetch from GET /api/admin/treasury/summary and /api/admin/treasury/reconcile
- Display:
  • virtual balance
  • inflow/outflow counts
  • chart of treasury_pool_snapshots over time (Recharts LineChart)
  • last reconciliation status
  • “Run Reconciliation” button

4️⃣ NAV Management
- Extend /admin/projects/:id
- Add “NAV” tab showing:
  • current NAV
  • NAV history table (superseded entries)
  • Form to submit new NAV (POST /api/admin/projects/:id/nav)
  • Auto-refresh list after submission
  • Apply auditActionWithState middleware logs.

5️⃣ Cashflow Management
- Route: /admin/cashflows
- List of project_cashflows with status (recorded / verified / tokenized)
- Show columns: project name, revenue amount, recordedAt, verifiedBy, verifiedAt
- “Verify” button → updates verification via PUT /api/admin/cashflows/:id/verify

6️⃣ Audit Log Viewer
- Route: /admin/audit
- Table for audit_admin_actions
- Columns: timestamp, admin, action, target, metadata
- Add filters: by action type, by admin, by date range.

UI/UX Requirements:
- Use shadcn/ui components with consistent theme.
- Use Card and Tabs components for modular pages.
- Include loading states, error toasts, and empty states.
- Code should be fully typed and maintainable (no any).

Deliverables:
✅ New pages/components in /app/admin/*
✅ API integration with existing endpoints
✅ Type-safe interfaces for all responses
✅ Basic tests for key components
✅ Update replit.md documentation

Objective:
Complete visual + functional parity with the Phase 4-B backend so that the regenerative capital system is fully operational from the admin and investor UI.
