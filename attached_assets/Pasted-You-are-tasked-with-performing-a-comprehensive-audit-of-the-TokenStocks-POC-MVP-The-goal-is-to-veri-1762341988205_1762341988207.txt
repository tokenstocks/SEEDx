You are tasked with performing a comprehensive audit of the TokenStocks POC MVP. The goal is to verify functionality, data integrity, and end-to-end workflow readiness for demonstration. Please produce a structured, detailed report that my architect (GPT-5-mini) can review and prioritize for POC readiness.

1. **Backend Verification**
   - Test all user flows:
     - Registration, login, KYC submission and approval
     - Bank verification and withdrawals
     - NGNTS issuance, project token minting
     - Multi-currency investment flow
     - Redemption system:
       - NAV locking
       - Hybrid funding priority (project → treasury → LP)
       - Liquid/time-locked/permanent token handling
   - Test Treasury Pool allocations:
     - Auto-distribution ratios (default 60/20/10/10)
     - Manual override per project
     - Ensure sums match total project cashflow
   - Test LP investor token tracking and cashflow allocation
   - Marketplace engine:
     - Order matching (buy/sell)
     - Atomic transactions
   - Blockchain integration:
     - Stellar transactions recorded correctly
     - Token balances match database

2. **Frontend Verification**
   - Admin dashboards:
     - Treasury, Cashflows, NAV management
     - Redemptions, Audit logs
   - LP Dashboard:
     - Overview, Portfolio, Cashflows, Profile
     - Liquid/time-locked/permanent token visibility
     - Redemption validation
   - Marketplace:
     - Buy/sell orders, order book updates
   - Project detail pages:
     - NAV display, cashflow history

3. **Test Runs with Sample Data**
   - Create 2–3 projects with different token types (liquid, time-locked, grant)
   - Make multiple investments in NGNTS, USDC, XLM
   - Process redemptions for both liquid and locked tokens
   - Execute marketplace trades
   - Record treasury and LP cashflow allocations
   - Verify auto-distribution works and manual overrides are respected

4. **Integrity Checks**
   - Ensure token sums match issued amounts
   - Validate NAV and redemption calculations
   - Confirm LP liquid/locked balances are accurate
   - Check that blockchain transactions align with database records

5. **Output**
   - Structured table/report:
     - Workflow / Feature | Status (PASS / FAIL / WARNING) | Notes / Errors / Missing
   - Highlight critical blocking issues
   - List minor bugs or optional UX enhancements
   - Confirm whether MVP is functional for POC demo
   - Provide screenshots or example logs where possible

Deliver the output in a way that allows the architect (GPT-5-mini) to quickly review, prioritize, and sign off the POC MVP for demonstration.
