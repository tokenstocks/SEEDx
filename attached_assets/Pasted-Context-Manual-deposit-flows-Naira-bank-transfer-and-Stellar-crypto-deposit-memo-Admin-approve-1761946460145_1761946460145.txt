Context: Manual deposit flows — Naira bank transfer and Stellar crypto deposit (memo). Admin approves and credits wallets.

Goal: implement wallet deposit flows, deposit_request and transaction records, admin approval endpoints, and update wallet balances accordingly.

Deliverables (server):
1. Prisma models for:
   - DepositRequest (id UUID, userId, transactionId, amount, currency enum, payment_proof_url, status enum pending/approved/rejected, admin_notes, processed_by, processed_at, timestamps)
   - (If not already) Transactions model to log every wallet change
2. Endpoints:
   - POST /api/wallets/deposit/initiate
     - Input: {currency: NGN|USDC|XLM}
     - If NGN: return TOKENSTOCKS_BANK_ACCOUNT and a generated unique reference code (string) tied to a transaction (create transaction: deposit pending)
     - If USDC/XLM: return TOKENSTOCKS_STELLAR_ADDRESS and a generated memo (unique), create pending transaction record
   - POST /api/wallets/deposit/confirm
     - Input: {transaction_reference, amount, optional payment_proof (file), currency}
     - Create deposit_request record with status pending and upload payment_proof to Supabase Storage if provided
   - GET /api/admin/deposits (admin-only)
     - Returns list of pending deposit_request with user info and proof URLs
   - PUT /api/admin/deposits/:id (admin-only)
     - Body: {action: approve|reject, approvedAmount (for approve), admin_notes}
     - If approve:
       - Mark deposit_request.status = approved
       - Update underlying transaction.status = completed
       - Update user wallet balance (add approvedAmount) — careful to handle decimal operations
       - Record processed_by and processed_at
       - Notify user (email placeholder)
     - If reject: mark deposit_request.status = rejected and transaction.status = failed
3. Concurrency/atomicity:
   - Use DB transaction for approve flow to avoid race conditions (Prisma transaction)
4. Admin UI API requirements:
   - Endpoint security: only admin role can access admin endpoints (use auth middleware + role check)
5. Example curl or Postman steps and tests for admin approve flow

Also:
- Provide server code snippets to create unique reference codes and memos
- Use decimal strings for money to avoid float precision issues

Acceptance criteria:
- User can initiate deposit and confirm deposit (creates pending DB records)
- Admin can view pending deposits and approve them which updates wallet balances atomically
Next step: implement Projects, Token Issuance, and Investment flow (Phase 4).
